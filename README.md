### Password-Generator
//===============================================
<br>
Ever thought  about creating a password generator? Well, you're in luck!
This is an open source project that allows users to generate strong passwords. 
The code generates a random password of length 10 with the following rules:
- The password will contain at least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- The password will contain at least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- The password will contain at least one number
- The password will contains not only characters from the English alphabet and numbers, but punctuation symbols also
which makes it even more harder to crack !!! 
Happy Hacking 😁🔒✌🏻
