### Password-Generator <br>
Ever thought  about creating a password generator? Well, you're in luck!<br>
This is an open source project that allows users to generate strong passwords. <br>
The code generates a random password of length 10 with the following rules:<br>
- The password will contain at least one uppercase letter (A-Z)<br>
- The password will contain at least one lowercase letter (a-z)<br>
- The password will contain at least one number<br>
- The password will contains not only characters from the English alphabet and numbers, but punctuation symbols also which makes it even more harder to crack !!! <br>
